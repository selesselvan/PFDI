# Python for Data Science Crash Course

**Certification Achievement: Intro to Numpy and Pandas**

I have successfully completed the Intro to Numpy and Pandas course, a free, 2-week cohort-based program focused on the fundamentals of scientific Python.

During this course, I worked with real Airbnb datasets and built real-world projects while learning the following skills:

- Basics of file input and output

- Computation on arrays

- Aggregation techniques

- Slicing, indexing, and modifying arrays

- Working with Pandas data structures (Series and DataFrames)

- Data manipulation and analysis with Python

This course strengthened my ability to use key Python data science libraries like Pandas and Numpy effectively for practical data analysis tasks.
